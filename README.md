## Practicing flexbox
Project is mainly built as part of The Odin Project Curriculum.  After extensive practice and reading of various CSS fundamentals, this was essentially the 'final' project at the end to actually apply and utilize what I have learned so far.

## Responive design
While the course says not to worry about making it responsive, I figured why not push myself a bit further and try to do just that!  So I worked on making this landing page with the mindset of making it look presentable in both a wide/large display, as well as looking good for any mobile device display.
